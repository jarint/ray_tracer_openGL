Platform: MacOS 

### TO RUN:
1. ```mkdir build```
2. ```cd build```
3. ```cmake ..```
4. ```make```
5. ```./RayTracing```

on visual studio I guess you can just hit the play button. 

### IMPLEMENTATIONS:
All basic implementations completed. Bonus 1 also completed.

My implementation of Bonus one borrows a lot of math from David Cobbs derivation and implementation
of Ray-Cylinder intersections. Check the comments in Shape.cpp for more info. The link for the page is:
